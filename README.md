# autodbconv (Automotive Database Converter)

**This project is in very early stages. Everything will change.**

Easy to use Rust library for parsing and generating code from automotive database files (NCF, LDF, DBC). Binaries are available for command line usage. Intended for embedded code generation and debugging using tools like [JABI](https://github.com/dragonlock2/JABI).

## TODO

- parser for NCF/LDF/DBC
- generator for native Rust => bind to Dart/Flutter
- generator for Python
- generator for Zephyr C++
- tool for combining NCF and LDF
